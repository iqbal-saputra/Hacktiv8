Urban Value is a subdivision of Brighton.co.id, a company in the real estate industry known for its commitment to innovation and data-driven solutions.

As part of Brighton.co.id, the Urban Value Data Team utilizes regression methods and data analysis to provide in-depth and accurate insights into the real estate sector, specifically in forecasting property prices in the Nusantara Capital (IKN) and the areas of Balikpapan and Samarinda.

  ## Problem Statement
The Relocation of the Capital and Its Impact on the Housing Market:
  
  The impending relocation of Indonesia's capital to Nusantara is anticipated to significantly influence the housing market in the surrounding areas, particularly in Balikpapan and Samarinda. Such a major infrastructure shift is likely to lead to changes in property demand, price fluctuations, and investment opportunities.
  
The Importance of Accurate Data-Driven Insights:

To navigate these potential changes effectively, obtaining accurate, data-driven insights is crucial. Reliable data allows stakeholders—including property investors, policymakers, and urban planners—to anticipate market trends, make informed decisions, and develop strategies that align with the evolving real estate landscape. Data-driven insights help in understanding how the capital relocation might affect various aspects of the housing market, such as pricing dynamics, demand shifts, and regional development.

Comprehensive Data Collection:

Achieving precise and actionable insights requires comprehensive data collection. This involves gathering a wide range of information on property characteristics, historical price trends, market demand, and economic factors that may be influenced by the capital move. Using advanced techniques such as data scraping and machine learning algorithms, we can aggregate and analyze vast amounts of real estate data to uncover patterns and predict future market behavior.

## Project Objective
- Provide comprehensive, data-driven insights into how the relocation of the capital is likely to affect real estate values and market trends in the targeted areas. This includes understanding the impact on supply and demand, price fluctuations, and investment opportunities. 
- Model Accuracy and Performance to ensure the predictive models are highly accurate and reliable, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on the latest and most relevant data.
- Conduct extensive data collection and analysis to build a thorough understanding of the real estate market dynamics in Balikpapan and Samarinda. This involves integrating various data sources and applying advanced machine learning methods to uncover valuable insights.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to enhance decision-making capabilities in the real estate sector and support effective planning and investment strategies in light of the upcoming capital relocation.
